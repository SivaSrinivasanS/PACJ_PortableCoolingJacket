# PACJ: Portable Air Conditioning Jacket (PoC Design Study)

**A conceptual 3D CAD project exploring the integration of compact cooling systems into a wearable jacket format.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **PACJ (Portable Air Conditioning Jacket)** is a **proof-of-concept** design created using **SolidWorks**. The aim was to evaluate whether critical subsystems of a compact cooling system—such as thermoelectric modules, battery systems, and fluid networks—can be spatially arranged within the constraints of wearable clothing.

This non-parametric CAD modeling project emphasizes:

- **Visualizing key components** of a wearable cooling system  
- **Exploring spatial feasibility** and modular layout  
- **Demonstrating packaging logic** and subsystem interactions  
- **Delivering professional documentation** for further engineering review
